I was looking through Coderwall to see how many developers had some crazy skills like this woman:

But sadly it turns out that many developers haven't added their skills to their profile. Last week less, just under 50% of developers that joined Coderwall have declared a skill. We thought it would be fun to change things up and make the suggested defaults something you wouldn't normally expect to see:

We originally did this just to make the page more fun, we were surprised by how many developers entered their skills. It seems the thought of IE6 is enough for nearly everyone to add their skills.

What skills would you hate to have?

[EDIT]

We updated the UI to make it very clear these are only suggestions. If you decide not to select a skill, nothing will show up on your public profile.
