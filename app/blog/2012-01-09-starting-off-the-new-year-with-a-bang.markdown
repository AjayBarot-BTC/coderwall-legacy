We're starting off the new year at Coderwall with some big news. Let's get right to it.

### Coderwall is Growing

First off, I'd like to welcome [Brian Guthrie](http://coderwall.com/bguthrie) to the team. Brian will be joining us to help build out the site and take responsibility for some of the technical direction. He'll also be cracking some bad jokes and generally lowering the tone around here. We're looking forward to him ruining the site in the coming months.

### New badge dropping: Erlang!

We've also gone ahead and integrated a new badge to the site. We're proud to announce the addition of Erlang to the list of languages that we track and award achievements for. We're using the fierce [desert locust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_locust) in homage to Erlang's lightweight, massively scalable process model, and also because Erlang programmers are [gregarious and migratory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locust). Here's what the badge looks like:

![Fear the swarm](http://coderwall.com/images/badges/desertlocust.png)
![For the horde](http://coderwall.com/images/badges/desertlocust3.png)

If you've already released some open-source Erlang code, great! You should see it show up on your profile in the next couple of days. And if you haven't had a chance to try Erlang before and would like to get cracking with that achievement, we recommend that you go out and [learn you some Erlang for great good](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/). 

You may have have noticed that this badge looks a little bit different than most others. We're trying out some new badge designs on the site, and if you have any feedback on this first one we'd [love to hear it](mailto:support@coderwall.com).

### Badge Mondays

Starting from today we're going to be dropping new badges your way every Monday. We're excited to be getting into a rhythm for badge releases, and we hope it gives you some motivation to get cracking on learning some new code this week.
