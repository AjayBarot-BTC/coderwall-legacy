Hey <%= @user.short_name %>,

You're getting the first chance to unlock the brand new Entrepreneur Badge. Get a commit accepted to an Assembly product, earn the badge and let the money start rolling in!

If you didn't know about Assembly, it's a crowd-building platform for Apps. Each month, the community picks an idea for an application. Then using Assembly, the app is built collaboratively and monthly profits are rewarded to all the contributors.

Follow these three steps to unlock the badge:

1. Visit Assembly to learn more about Helpful (a support tool) https://assemblymade.com/helpful.

2. Find an open task on the WIPs page (https://assemblymade.com/helpful/wips) or jump in and create your own WIP

3. Once done, submit your pull request to the GitHub repo (https://github.com/asm-helpful/helpful-web) and kick back with your new Entrepreneur badge

Happy Coding
